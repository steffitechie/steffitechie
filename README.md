ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @steffitechie
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Steffany Winroth, an aspiring programmer with a passion for technology, philosophy, and making the world more equal.

About Me
ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently pursuing a double candidate BA major at Stockholm University, where I study International Relations and will later explore Economics.
ðŸŒŸ Iâ€™m deeply curious about how programming can be used to address global challenges and promote equality.
ðŸ§© As someone with autism, I embrace my focus and determinationâ€”qualities that drive me to learn programming despite not being a math whiz.

Interests
ðŸ‘€ Programming for Good: Iâ€™m interested in projects that contribute to a better, more equitable world.
â™Ÿ Chess: A lifelong love.
ðŸ§  Philosophy: Exploring how big ideas intersect with technology and society.

Fun Fact
âš¡ My autism makes me uniquely stubbornâ€”in a good way! Once I became fascinated with programming, I couldnâ€™t stop, even if it meant diving into concepts that initially seemed out of reach.
